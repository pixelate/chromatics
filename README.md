* [Calculating frequency](https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/NoteFreqCalcs.html) for a given musical note 
* Using [Enumerations](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Enumerations.html#ID146), [Dictionaries](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/CollectionTypes.html#ID113), [Tuples](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html#ID329) and [Structs](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ClassesAndStructures.html#ID83) in Swift
